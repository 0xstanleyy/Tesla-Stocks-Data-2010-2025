# Tesla-Stocks-Data-2010-2025
**Project Type**:Data retrieval → cleaning/EDA → interactive visualization

**Scope**: G20 + Nigeria economies, 2018–2023

**Tools**: Python ( pandas, matplotlib/seaborn)

# Aims and Objectives
To conduct a Technical Analysis (TA) on Tesla's historical stock data (TSLA) by establishing a robust data visualization pipeline that reveals long-term price movements and the relationship between trading volume and closing price from 2010 to 2025.

**Key Trend 1**: The Long Stable Phase (2010–2019)
* Observation: For approximately 10 years, the stock price remained relatively low and stable. The initial growth was slow, with the price fluctuating within a      narrow range (before accounting for stock splits).

* Finding: This decade was characterized by low volatility and gradual, measured growth. This period reflects the company's early years of manufacturing and   scaling production, where investor confidence and market valuation remained cautious.

**Key Trend 2**: The Hyper-Growth and Volatility Phase (2020–2025)
* Observation: Around 2020, the stock price enters an exponential growth curve. The value increases dramatically, reaching its peak price multiples higher than      the previous decade.

* Finding: This phase is defined by extreme volatility. The sharp, rapid increases are punctuated by deep, sudden corrections (drawdowns). This indicates a highly   speculative and reactive market, likely driven by factors like inclusion in the S&P 500, production milestones, and broader market sentiment toward EV             technology.

**Key Trend 3**: Post-Peak Swings (2022–2024)
* Observation: The period following the initial 2020-2021 surge shows sustained high prices but also significant swings—the peaks and troughs are much more          pronounced than in the stable phase.

* Finding: The chart reveals increased price discovery and market indecision at higher valuations. The stock continues to demonstrate a strong upward bias over      the entire period, but risk (measured by volatility) remains significantly elevated.

**Observation** : The Price plot shows a massive exponential increase starting around 2020. The Volume plot simultaneously shows a drastic, sustained surge in daily trading activity, peaking in the same period.

**Finding (The Volume-Price Relationship)** : The strong correlation between the two signals Trend Confirmation.

**Low Volume + Stable Price (2010–2019)**: The early, slow price movements were not backed by high market participation (institutional or retail). This indicates that the trend during this decade lacked the conviction to sustain rapid movement.

**High Volume + Rising Price (2020–2025)**: The explosive price move was validated and confirmed by the significant increase in trading volume. In technical analysis, when price moves up on increasing volume, it is a strong bullish signal. This suggests the rally was driven by strong demand and major commitment from market participants.
